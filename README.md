A consolidated calendar view for planning your week at Utah Tech Week and the Silicon Slopes Summit (February 2-7, 2026).

**Live Site:** https://emersonlebleu.github.io/tech_week_planner/

## Source Data

This calendar combines events from two sources, collected on **January 27, 2026**:

- [Utah Tech Week Events](https://app.getriver.io/utahtechweek)
- [Silicon Slopes Summit](https://community.summit.ing/events/summit-2026/sessions) - Main stage sessions Wed-Sat

## How to Use

1. Visit the [live site](https://emersonlebleu.github.io/tech_week_planner/)
2. Browse events by day, type, or location
3. Hover over events to see details and action buttons
4. Click "add" to add events to your schedule
5. Click "Export" to download your schedule as a text file. 
6. You can import this file over to another browser if you need. That is why you'll see some odd stuff at the very end of the exported file after the "human" schedule.

## Important Notes

**Your schedule is stored in your browser's localStorage.** This means:
- Your selections persist between sessions on the same browser
- Clearing browser data will erase your schedule
